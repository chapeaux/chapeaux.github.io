# Chapeaux Project

A relatively unopinionated toolset built around enterprise-grade, functional, web components.

## Three Primary Concerns (3Ds)

* **Develop:** create enterprise-grade, functional, web components
* **Discover:** centralize the ability to find web components (and related assets) in an enterprise-wide catalog
* **Deliver:** standardize an enterprise-wide, web component (and related assets) delivery system

## Non-Concerns of the project (valid concerns, mostly just not answered here)

* Visual style or design
* Library or framework selection
* Etc.

## Examples of functional web components

* Search querying
* Element filtering
* URL parsing
* Templating
* Containers
* Service request and response handling
* Auto-complete/suggest data
